# Temporal Feature Extraction - Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview

I've implemented a complete temporal feature extraction system for your NFT contract analysis project. This new module extracts and analyzes temporal patterns from both **contract creators** and **smart contracts**.

---

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Main Extraction Script (`extract_temporal_features.py`)

**Features Extracted:**

#### Creator Transaction Activity:
- ‚úÖ Total transactions (sent/received)
- ‚úÖ Transaction values (ETH sent/received)
- ‚úÖ Transfer patterns (transfer, approve, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Activity before/after contract creation
- ‚úÖ Temporal patterns (hourly/daily distribution)
- ‚úÖ Transaction frequency metrics

#### Smart Contract Transaction Activity:
- ‚úÖ Mint operations (token creation)
- ‚úÖ Burn operations (token destruction)
- ‚úÖ Withdraw operations (fund extraction)
- ‚úÖ Transfer operations (token movements)
- ‚úÖ NFT transfer events (ERC721)
- ‚úÖ Unique participants (senders/receivers)
- ‚úÖ Contract age and activity metrics
- ‚úÖ Temporal patterns and burst detection

### 2. Analysis Script (`analyze_temporal_features.py`)

**Generates:**
- Statistical summaries (min, max, mean, median)
- Top creators by activity
- Top contracts by activity
- Comprehensive markdown reports
- JSON summary data

### 3. Supporting Files

- ‚úÖ `test_temporal_setup.py` - Verify setup before running
- ‚úÖ `TEMPORAL_FEATURES_USAGE.md` - Complete documentation
- ‚úÖ README with examples and troubleshooting

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Set Up Etherscan API Key

Get a free API key from: https://etherscan.io/apis

**Set environment variable:**

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:ETHERSCAN_API_KEY = "YourActualApiKeyHere"
```

Or edit `extract_temporal_features.py` line 10 and replace `'YourApiKeyToken'` with your key.

### Step 2: Verify Setup

```powershell
python test_temporal_setup.py
```

### Step 3: Extract Features

```powershell
python extract_temporal_features.py
```

**Expected time:** ~5-10 minutes for 85 contracts (due to API rate limiting)

### Step 4: Generate Reports

```powershell
python analyze_temporal_features.py
```

## üîç Analysis Capabilities

With this data, you can now:

1. **Identify Suspicious Patterns**
   - Contracts with immediate withdrawals after minting
   - Creators with unusual transaction patterns
   - Abandoned contracts (no recent activity)

2. **Correlate with Vulnerabilities**
   - Do high-vulnerability contracts have different temporal patterns?
   - Are cloned contracts deployed at similar times?
   - Creator behavior before/after deployment

3. **Risk Assessment**
   - Contract activity ratio (active days vs age)
   - Burst activity detection (pump and dump?)
   - Creator transaction history

4. **Machine Learning Features**
   - 50+ temporal features per contract
   - Ready for classification/clustering
   - Time series analysis

## üîó Integration with Existing Analysis

This temporal feature extraction complements your existing analysis:

| Existing Module | Temporal Integration |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| Similarity Analysis | Compare temporal patterns of clone pairs |
| Vulnerability Analysis | Correlate vulnerabilities with activity patterns |
| Clone Detection | Check if clones share temporal characteristics |

## üí° Key Insights You Can Derive

1. **Creator Behavior Analysis**
   - Is the creator still active?
   - Did creator withdraw funds immediately?
   - Transaction patterns before/after launch

2. **Contract Lifecycle**
   - How long has contract been active?
   - Is it abandoned?
   - Activity trends over time

3. **NFT Activity Patterns**
   - Minting velocity
   - Burn rate
   - Secondary market activity
   - Holder concentration

4. **Risk Indicators**
   - High burn rate (rug pull?)
   - Immediate withdrawals (scam?)
   - No recent activity (abandoned?)
   - Burst activity (pump and dump?)

**Implementation Complete!** üéâ

All code is ready to run. Just set your Etherscan API key and execute the scripts.
